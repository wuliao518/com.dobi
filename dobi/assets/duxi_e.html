		Du has employed specific visual devices in his artworks depicting China from 1912 to 1949, the period of early industrialization. The yellow tone of the canvas resembles the aged photo papers. Figures in the work are the embodiment of distinct poses, gestures, attitudes and facial expressions. The artworks imply that a camera, the newly introduced device at the time, has captured the heroes, heroines and everyone else in the new era.
